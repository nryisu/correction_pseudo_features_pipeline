## scRNA-seq datasets
The datasets from [Kumar et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13920). The raw data can be download from [GSE60749](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60749). We downloaded the individual nestin-positive neural precursor cells and v6.5 mESCs cultured in serum+LIF media for comparison.
## Annotation
The annotation folder contains detailed information for analysis.
## Alignment
The alignment folder contains the commands for obtaining the count matrix from the raw data(fastq file format).
## Downstream 
The downstream folder contains the commands for downstream analysis from the count matrix.
